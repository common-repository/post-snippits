Use shortcodes to automatically insert common snippits of text and code in to your posts and pages.

== Description ==

* Useful for inserting adverts in to certain posts, or other common pieces of code which you can manage centrally.

* Contact details or addresses can be set as a snippet and easily updated centrally rather than having to go through each post.

* Use the Post Snippits Settings page to define your snippits, then use the shortcode [snippit name] in your posts or pages where "name" is the name you have defined in the settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'post-snippits' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Begin defining your snippits in the Settings page
